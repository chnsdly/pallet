"Our products have been rigorously validated in China's demanding market environment, earning high recognition from key strategic clients. This gives us full confidence to embrace global market challenges and opportunities," emphasized Wei Benlong, General Manager, at the strategy launch. "Overseas expansion is both a strategic imperative and a testament to our technological and product confidence. We're fully prepared to create value for international clients with an open approach and professional services."

This global strategy builds on three core advantages:

**Technology Confidence, Product Excellence**:  
Our flagship products feature advanced prismatic aluminum-shell LiFePO4 technology, offering superior safety, extended lifespan, wide temperature tolerance, and exceptional consistency - perfectly meeting global power battery demands. The mature platform delivers performance benchmarks at international advanced levels.

**Lean Smart Manufacturing, Capacity Assurance**:  
With industry-leading automated, intelligent production lines, we ensure strong mass-delivery capabilities and consistent quality output, effectively supporting rapid response to international market demands.

**Certification First, Compliant Operations**:  
We prioritize international compliance, with core products actively pursuing key global certifications including UN38.3, IEC 62619, and UL. This ensures regulatory alignment and smooth market entry worldwide.

Initially, we'll focus on regions with strong demand for light electric vehicles and premium lithium solutions, while exploring diverse overseas opportunities. Through international exhibitions, channel partnerships, and targeted marketing, we'll enhance global brand recognition and influence.
