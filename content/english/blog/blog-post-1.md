**Qingyuan Beverages** — a well-known beverage producer in East China.  
The plant outputs tens of thousands of bottles per day, with more than **15,000 pallet cycles** daily.

## 1. Project Background

Qingyuan runs 24/7 continuous production with high-turnover warehousing. As orders kept climbing, outdated wooden pallets increasingly caused safety, hygiene and cost issues, threatening line stability and GMP audit scores.

## 2. Challenges

**Wood-chip contamination**  
Typical symptom: splinters from wooden pallets drift into the filling line and trigger shutdowns.  
Business impact: unplanned downtime exceeded **4 h per month**.  

**Moisture & mold**  
Typical symptom: pallets absorb water, mold and exceed hygiene limits.  
Business impact: repeated GMP deductions; extra sanitation required.  

**Structural failure**  
Typical symptom: pallet breakage or warping leads to product tipping.  
Business impact: scrap rate ≈ 30 %; rising loss and claims.  

**Manual burden**  
Typical symptom: water-soaked pallets become heavier, increasing handling effort.  
Business impact: higher injury risk and overtime costs.

## 3. Solution

**Upgrade to Baoheng food-grade PP plastic pallets**  
One-piece injection-moulded pallets with smooth, burr-free surfaces and anti-slip grid. FDA-grade PP allows high-pressure wash-down and resists deformation under **1.6 t static load from -35 °C to +60 °C**.  

**Minor layout tweaks**  
Rack locations were re-marked to fit the new pallet size, and drip-dry racks were added in the wash area to speed turnaround.

## 4. Results (within 3 weeks of go-live)

**Wood-chip contamination**  
Before: 5–6 unexpected shutdowns per week.  
After: fully eliminated; shutdowns **0**.  

**GMP deductions**  
Before: 2–3 penalty points per spot-check.  
After: **0** points; hygiene risk cleared.  

**Pallet breakage rate**  
Before: ≈ 30 %; high repair spend.  
After: **< 1 %**; almost no repair cost.  

**Manual burden**  
Before: high strain on forklift staff; injury & overtime risk.  
After: handling effort down **≈ 33 %**; injuries and overtime drop sharply.  

**Annual savings**  
Optimising downtime, scrap and labour is projected to save **≈ ¥650,000 per year**.
