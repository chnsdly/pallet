## Client Challenges: "Range Anxiety" in Alleyway Navigation
Hutong Express, a leading Shanghai supply chain provider for convenience stores, pharmacies and e-commerce platforms, operates fleets of small electric trikes and micro-vans (0.6-1 ton class) for high-frequency urban deliveries.

Their electrification journey faced unique small-vehicle challenges:

### "200km Daily Range" Insufficient
Existing batteries couldn't sustain full loads with AC/heating in frequent start-stop operations, forcing mid-shift recharging.

### "Minute-Counting" Charging Time
Drivers wasted hours daily with 4-6 hour slow charging at service points, reducing vehicle utilization.

### Reliability Under "Bumpy Road Tests"
Shanghai's brick alleyways caused connector failures and BMS errors in existing batteries.

### TCO Pressure in "Cost-Sensitive" Operations
Short battery life and frequent repairs eroded thin profit margins.

## Hengli Solution: Enduring Power for "Urban Sprites"
Customized HL-M50 Series LiFePO4 batteries addressed these pain points:

### Compact High-Energy Packs
50-60 kWh HL-M50 packs (15% higher volumetric density) fit small vehicles while extending range.

### "Coffee Break" Fast Charging
1.5C fast charging enables 30%-80% recharge during 40-45 min lunch breaks.

### Vibration-Tough Design
Reinforced aluminum shells with cushioning structures pass rigorous vibration tests.

### Extended Life Economics
>3500 cycles (@80% DoD) with 5-year/300,000-km warranty reduce per-km costs.

## Results: Efficiency-Cost Transformation
Since late 2023 deployment, Hutong Express's fleet has transformed:

### Range Breakthrough
**220-250 km** real-world range (peak **280 km/day**) eliminates "afternoon anxiety".

### Efficiency Leap
- **+1.8 hrs** daily operation via lunch charging
- **15% higher** deliveries per driver
- **>98% fleet availability** (vs. 92% previously)

### Cost Optimization
- **>60% lower** energy costs vs. fuel vehicles
- **40% fewer** battery-related repairs
- Industry-leading TCO for thin-margin operations

### Flawless Safety Record
Zero safety incidents after **200+ km/day** operation on Shanghai's toughest roads.

## Client Testimonial
> "Hengli's HL-M50 batteries solved our urban delivery bottleneck. Drivers now 'recharge to full' during lunch and deliver farther with confidence. Their durability amazed us - minimal failures despite Shanghai's bumpy roads. Beyond the robust product, Hengli's team offers rapid, insightful service. These batteries are trusted partners for our 'city navigators'! We're phasing out older batteries across our fleet."
